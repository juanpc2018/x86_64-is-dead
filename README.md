x86_64-is-dead
find something else. LOLâ„¢

intel and AMD had an agreement to share patents, 
intel has 32-Bit
AMD has 64-Bit,
but with 64-Bit Only OS, 64-Bit Apps,
AMD can remove x86 code from the CPUs, and Intel has to pay AMD for using 64-Bit.

Removing useless code from the CPUs will make them more power efficient, easy & faster to manufacture = cheaper.
maybe some will include a switch, that can be activated with a paid license in the UEFI Bios to power the x86 core.

That will create a very agresive shift towards ARM and RISC-V, some to POWER9 & 10
AMD will be the only developer of x64 CISC technology,
IBM Power9/10 will be the only CISC x64 competitor.
MIPS died with Sillicon Graphics, but... this will bring R18000 back from the dead.
Russia will continue to improve / develop the ELBRUS Cpu technology.
Intel itanium64 is finally dead. LOL.
but...
Intel fab will replace TSMC, and will focus in fabricating alternative technologies, ARM, RISC, MIPS.
probably intel fab will manufacture AMD cpus in the future.
intel is "just a fab."
MIPS died because it was fabricated with 130nm, same happened with AIM PowerPC G5 970MP CPU with 90nm,
but with today technology, MIPS can be a game changer...
POWER architecture is similar to Epyc / Threadripper, but with 4x Threads per core like Xeon Phi.
Most operating systems are Not designed to take advantage of Many cores,
are designed for Many Interrupts with Very Fast Cores "like intel". 

Operating systems & Computers will split in 2, 
Many Interrupts with Fast 10-Core CPUS,
vs.
1000-core/thread CPU with No interrupts.

P.D. IF it does Not have at least 2x Thuderbolt ports its useless crap. $0usd in the used market.


Alternatives:

4-core CPU.
8GB RAM Non-upgredable.

RISC-V
2-core CPU.

Rasberry Pi4B can be "upgraded" with PCIe Riser card,
removing the VL800 USB IC, and soldering a PCB Bridge or wires.
